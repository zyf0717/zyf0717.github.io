Hello! Since this is my first blog post using Jekyll, I will be trying out Jekyll's built-in support for code snippets with syntax highlighting for various languages.


```python
## Python
def hello_world():
    x = "Hello, World!"
    print(x)
```

```julia
## Julia
function helloworld()
    x = "Hello, World!"
    println(x)
end
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
function helloWorld() {
  var x = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(x);
}
```

Seems pretty decent!
