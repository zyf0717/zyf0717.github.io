My [previous post](https://blog.yifei.sg/jekyll/update/2020/08/17/apache-web-server-gcp.html) on setting up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine (VM) was one of the few times I ever used GCP. 

There is currently an ongoing Google event called [#MahjulahGCP](https://events.withgoogle.com/majulahgcp-learn-data-analytics-using-google-cloud/) (return for season 2 actually) running from 11 September to 11 October 2020. I signed up and spent a couple of days completing a number of courses (called Quests) each involving multiple Lab sessions. The theme of this season is machine learning and data analytics.

Do check out the event here, especially if you are interested in learning how to use GCP for machine learning or data analytics, or just to earn the following swags:

You will be given 1 month of free access to [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) upon registration to complete Quests and Labs.

My public profile can be found [here](https://www.qwiklabs.com/public_profiles/bbb345e6-19fc-4b7a-a0ab-507877cf9ef2), and I am already looking forward to receiving my swags. :grin:
