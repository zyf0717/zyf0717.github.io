It has been almost a year since I began my committed journey into programming and data science. It only seems appropriate to look back and review what I have been doing over the past year, and highlight what I have learnt. The sections below occur mostly in chronological order, with some overlaps.

## Udacity
My journey started on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), with Intro to Computer Science (CS101) taught in Python 2. With the end-of-life of Python 2, CS101 has been replaced by [Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) (UD1110), which I had also quickly gone through. The former course places a greater emphasis on computer science rather than learning a new language. Personally, I prefer the CS101 course as it lays the foundation for further computer science courses.

Next, I completed the following courses on Udacity:
- [Intro to Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215) (CS215)
- Programming Foundations with Python (UD036)
- [Intro to Data analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) (UD170)
- [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359) (UD359)
- [Data Analysis and Visualization](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization--ud404) (UD404)
- [Data Analysis with R](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651) (UD651)

I would say that courses above were sufficient for a decent introductions to computer science, data analysis, as well as Python and R, and also provides some fundamental programming skills.

## Coursera
The [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) was the first course I completed on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This was done partly as a recap and review of most of my previous courses, as well as to round out my fundamentals understanding of data science with a fully structured 9-course specialization.

Moving forward, I completed the acclaimed [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course taught by Andrew Ng. The courses were challenging, but extremely rewarding. To-date, the lectures delivered in this five-course series are what I would consider the best lectures I have ever attended, in-person or otherwise.

I will make it a point to complete the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Andrew Ng at some point as well. Personally, the only downside is that this course is taught in Octave or Matlab. Perhaps I would attempt to complete this course in Python, R or Julia.

## Stepik
[Stepik](https://stepik.org/) is a fantastic platform for cross-device use (both app- and browser-based), only hindered by the lack of available courses. Notwithstanding, both the [Data Structures](https://stepik.org/course/579/promo) and [Python Functional Programming](https://stepik.org/course/2057/promo) courses are excellent, and I highly recommend them. [JavaScript for Beginners](https://stepik.org/course/3432/promo) is also a pretty decent introduction to the language.

The courses on this platform are divided into bite-sized portions, making them very suitable for learning on-the-go. I went through most of the three aforementioned courses this way.

## Ubuntu
I have also moved from Windows to Ubuntu, briefly experimenting with various Ubuntu-based operating systems on various devices, including a low-powered Chromebook. Currently I am using [Elementary OS 5.1 Hera](https://elementary.io/) (which is based on Ubuntu 18.04) on my workstation, and Ubuntu 20.04 on my ultrabook and mini-PC.

## JetBrains Academy
To further my understanding of object-oriented programming, I decided to turn to [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/). Specifically, I went through few Java projects, during which I completed most of the object-oriented programming tutorials available, familiarised myself with Java syntax, and got a taste of what it is like to work with a statically-typed and compiled programming language.

My wife has also picked up programming through the Python track on JetBrains Academy. She has since completed around half of all available Python tutorials, and her experience has been positive. I would say that this platform is an excellent non-lecture way to pick up programming. 

JetBrains Academy has recently come out of beta, and unfortunately it is now subscription-based after a short trial period of up to two months.

## Julia
“Walk like Python, run like C” is a popular phrase in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) community. Founded in 2012, Julia is young with relatively fewer resources available to learners compared to mainstream languages. My main learning resource for Julia were the JuliaBox tutorials found on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaBoxTutorials).

With a Python background and basic static typing knowledge, the learning curve for Julia is rather flat, and I have already used Julia at work to get around absurd runtimes. Scripts written in Python and R, which originally took days or hours to run, ran in a couple of minutes or even seconds when transpiled to Julia. Multi-threading can be as simple as using `Threads.@threads` during for-loops (with various caveats).

It is worth mentioning that [JuliaAcademy](https://juliaacademy.com/) has also recently been set up, and there is also a new course on Coursera called [Julia Scientific Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming).

## Codewars
For about a month was obsessed Codewars, and I have written a [blogpost](https://zyf0717.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/06/learning-from-codewars.html) on this. Greatly improved my problem solving skills, as well as my familiarity with Python and JavaScript.

## Blogging
I finally got around to creating this blog in May this year, and I am determined to update it regularly so that my next year-in-review blogpost will not have be this long.

## Flutter and Dart
The creation and deployment of Apps has always a curiosity of mine, and I have written a [short blogpost](https://zyf0717.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/01/fluttering-and-darting.html) on this. My key learning from the short Flutter development course was asynchronous programming and state management.

## Exercism and HackerRank
I have also been solving problems on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) mainly using Scala and Python. Exercism is a unique site offering both learning and mentoring opportunities, while HackerRank is similar to Codewars. I will elaborate more on these two sites in a future blogpost.

## Scala
My current (and likely continued) obsession with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) was born out of its intriguing premise: the combination of object-oriented and functional programming in one high level language which is run on the JVM. I have already completed a [Udemy course on Scala](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/), and currently I am working on going through two books on Scala, with plans to also complete the Udemy courses on [advanced Scala](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-scala/) and [Spark and big data with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/course/spark-essentials/).

Up till this point, I have not studied any language to this extent or depth. Despite the high learning curve, I am determined to delve deep into this complex and wonderful language.

## Cluster computing
I have acquired and set up my very own compute cluster. Through having to configure headless Raspberry Pis, I have picked up quite a few Linux terminal commands, as well as some shell scripting.

Details of my setup span four blog posts, starting from [this one](https://zyf0717.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/23/pi-clustering-hardware.html).

## Upcoming plans
The following briefly outlines my upcoming plans (and blogposts) over the next few months:
- Beef up Scala and Spark knowledge
- Work on Python and Scala projects
- Deploy Spark jobs on my compute cluster
- Learn and experiment with Hadoop on my compute cluster
- Focus on problem solving in a declarative and functional manner
