Shiny for Python is now available, and so I am taking this opportunity to rewrite my [dashboard](https://blog.yifei.sg/jekyll/update/2024/05/07/dashboard-deployment-aws.html).

Updates so far: group-chats are supported, WhatsApp-support for a greater variety of Android devices have been implemented, and UI changes are being made to make the front-end more user-friendly.

A future blogpost will further detail this process as there are still ongoing changes.

The interim functional dashboard is currently accessible [here](http://18.142.41.111:8000/).
