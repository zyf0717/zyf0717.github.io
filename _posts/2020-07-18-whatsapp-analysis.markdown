A few days back I came across a post whereby the author conducted a thorough analysis of one of his/her WhatsApp chats. A quick Google search yielded a few more posts of a similar nature. Analysis was often done in Python or R, and various plotting/graphing packages were used. I thought it might be interesting to ultimately create a dashboard using Plotly and Dash rather than analysing every chat via Jupyter Notebooks. Hence, this blogpost is the first in a series where I set out some preliminary analysis of WhatsApp chat contents. If all goes well, the next blogpost will be about the dashboard process and outcome.
