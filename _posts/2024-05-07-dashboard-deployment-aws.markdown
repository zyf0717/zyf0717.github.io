## Update

Following my previous [post](https://zyf0717.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/08/18/dashboard-deployment.html), the current dashboard has been updated to support Telegram in addition to WhatsApp.

## Migration and redeployment

After having familiarised myself with the AWS stack over the past few years, I chose to use the free-tier EC2 on AWS for this current redeployment.

The dashboard can now be accessed [here](http://3.106.32.71:8050/).
